Office Map Web App - In development
===============

In a big office, new employees often need help to find co-workers. Why not build an interactive map of your office?

Demo : http://nic128.github.io/OfficeMapWebApp/

This app loads data from a JSON file and populates an office map. It lets you select and edit the person's position while dragging the pointers, or by a number input. When you click "Edit User list", it lets you modify the user's information, create or delete a user. It restores your data on page reload from sessionStorage.

This is a test app built with Angularjs and Twitter Bootstrap. No jQuery. angular-ui-bootstrap is used instead for Bootstrap components. 

* Angular Web site: http://angularjs.org
* Bootstrap Web site: http://getbootstrap.com
* angular-ui-bootstrap http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/
* Simple Sidebar template http://startbootstrap.com/simple-sidebar

To develop
---------
* Export a non-editable package for download
* Build a form to change the map image and the json source.
