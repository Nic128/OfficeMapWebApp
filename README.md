Office Map Web App
===============

In a big office, new employees often need help to find co-workers. Why not build an interactive map of your office?

Demo : http://nic128.github.io/OfficeMapWebApp/

This app loads data from a JSON file and populates an office map. In the map section, it lets you select and edit the person's position while dragging the pointers, or by a number input. In the user section, it lets you modify the user's information, create or delete a user. It restores your data on page reload from localStorage.

This is a test app built with Angularjs and Twitter Bootstrap by Nic128. No jQuery. angular-ui-bootstrap is used instead for Bootstrap components. Glyphicons are used for icons.
